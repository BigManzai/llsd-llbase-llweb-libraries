[] The ABNF in http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hamrick-vwrap-type-system-00 is
   patently incorrect (it excludes negative numbers, requires exponents, etc).
   The library code implements a "best guess" at what values will be supported,
   but it should be updated when the Internet Draft is revised.

[] XML generation is done using string concatenation, with little regard for
   encoding. A cross browser XML library should be included

[] The Binary type implements toJSON() but assume the LLSD rules for
   serialization discussed on the VWRAP mailing list (i.e. conversion to/from Base64
   strings). As the Type System document evolves, the implementation should track
   this. This may make it desirable to remove toJSON() and rely on explicit
   conversion in the JSON.stringify() call.

[] The Binary data type API is very loosely based on the CommonJS proposals.
   This provides a convenient API for string<->binary encodings (UTF-8, Base64).
   If a standard Binary datatype is adopted by the ECMAScript community, it should
   be used instead. See: http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Binary

[] The TypedArray data types are based on a Khronos Group draft specification
   for typed arrays for WebGL. This provides a convenient API for binary
   data packing/unpacking (e.g. octets<->IEEE754 floats). If the specification
   is refined and/or adopted, it should be used instead. See:
   https://cvs.khronos.org/svn/repos/registry/trunk/public/webgl/doc/spec/TypedArray-spec.html
