TO DO
=====

[] Update VS2008 and XCode projects with llsdserialize_json.cpp
   - And validate that the code works

[] clean up VS 2008 build
	[] put APR and expat libs under solution dir
	[] add readme for how to deal with external libs
	[] set warning level to 4 and use preprocessor.h (?)

[] reorganize source out indra/llcommon
	
[] tabs vs. spaces?

[] check that endianess code still works (how?)
	- only used for binary serialization of doubles
	- there is no unit test for this

[] bug in Notation parser's parse of UUIDs:
	- tries to read 36 characters, but then passes whole buffer,
	- no matter how many were actually read.

[] remove APR dependence
    [] base64 routines used in serialization
    [] getopt in test.cpp

[] use stdint.h rather than stdtypes.h (?)

[] figure out a home for hexvalue - rather than have two copies of it

[] clean up the insane use of memcpy in llsdserialize_tests.cpp

[] serious clean up of LLParser and subclasses
	- should hold stream as private var, and access only through members
	- noteFailure shouldn't have to create a std::string all the time
	- remove reset() - they can't be reset


FUTURE FEATURES
===============

[] XML parsing should really use max_bytes (not that it ever did...)

[] add MIME type negotiation support to llsdserialize
    [] get it done with once and for all!

[] thread safe code fixes:
    [] notes about statics
    [] no-ref count on undef values
    [] box/unbox calls
