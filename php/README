PHP LLSD Library
----------------

ABOUT
=====
This library implements LLSD in PHP. It represents most LLSD types as their
native PHP equivalent, but wraps UUID, URI, Date, and Binary in small
classes. Arrays and Maps both use PHP's array type. On serialization, arrays
become LLSD Arrays iff they have only contiguous numeric keys from 0, otherwise
they become LLAD Maps.

Only XML serialization is supported.


DEPENDENCIES
============
To run the unit tests, you need a copy of simpletest for PHP. It can be found
here:
    http://www.simpletest.org/
    
If you just download the standard distribution and unpack it here, everything
is set. If you have simpletest in another directory, simply fix up the path to
it in this file:
    index.php
    

RUNNING TESTS
=============
You can run the unit tests either on the command line, or from a browser.

On the command line:
    php index.php

From a browser:
Serve this directory from a web server. Then either browse to the base URL
you gave it, or <base URL>/index.php.
